The following repository is for gathering assignments and major projects into one location.

Major projects are briefly described, while smaller projects will be included in a table.

## Projects

**UX and Design Semester-Project:** - [Download Project PDF](https://github.com/bmmurthum/Class-Assignments/raw/master/A%20Redesign%20of%20Brendonsweb.pdf)

This project was done over the course of the semester in a course of Usability Design with lectures from Prof. Scott Grissom. It was built to resemble the student acting as a consultant to a company interested in redesigning a website. The project shows knowledge and practice of terminology in the field of UX; design of use-cases, user-tasks, and personas; use of low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes; and application of user-testing. The process was also a large exercise of writing valuable documentation, which was overviewed consistently by the professor. 

The course took an inspiration from UX expert David Platt's [The Joy of UX](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/013427671X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=013427671X&linkCode=as2&tag=rollingthun01-20&linkId=YVKN3DVRCGBMIBDT). With that, the course also heavily encourages a backbone of Don Norman's [Design Principles](https://www.csun.edu/science/courses/671/bibliography/preece.html) of *Visibility,* *Feedback,* *Constraint,* *Mapping,* *Consistency,* and *Affordance.* The course also leaves the student with many sources of academic studies and experts to lean on as they go into the future.

Good UX translates to (1) increased sales, (2) fewer errors by users, and (3) increased employee productivity.
