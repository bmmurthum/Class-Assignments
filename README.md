# Class-Assignments

The following repository is for gathering assignments and major projects into one location.

Major projects are briefly described, while smaller projects will be included in a table.

## Projects

**UX and Design Semester-Project:** - [Download Project PDF](https://github.com/bmmurthum/Class-Assignments/raw/master/A%20Redesign%20of%20Brendonsweb.pdf)

This project was done over the course of the semester in a course of Usability Design with lectures from Prof. Scott Grissom. It was built to resemble the student acting as a consultant to a company interested in redesigning a website. The project shows knowledge and practice of terminology in the field of UX; design of use-cases, user-tasks, and personas; use of low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes; and application of user-testing. The process was also a large exercise of writing valuable documentation, which was overviewed consistently by the professor. 

The course took an inspiration from UX expert David Platt's [The Joy of UX](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/013427671X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=013427671X&linkCode=as2&tag=rollingthun01-20&linkId=YVKN3DVRCGBMIBDT). With that, the course also heavily encourages a backbone of Don Norman's [Design Principles](https://www.csun.edu/science/courses/671/bibliography/preece.html) of *Visibility,* *Feedback,* *Constraint,* *Mapping,* *Consistency,* and *Affordance.* The course also leaves the student with many sources of academic studies and experts to lean on as they go into the future.

Good UX translates to (1) increased sales, (2) fewer errors by users, and (3) increased employee productivity. 

**Database Creation and Management Group-Project:** - [Download Project PDF](https://github.com/bmmurthum/Class-Assignments/raw/master/Project_submission.pdf) - [Download PL/SQL PDF](https://github.com/bmmurthum/Class-Assignments/raw/master/projectout.pdf)

This group project was done over several weeks later in the semester in a SQL Database course. It was an exercise in writing documentation that adheres to the desired requirements of an administrator, an exercise in creating EER diagrams and relational schemas, and an exercise in trialing many critical SQL queries involved in creation, deletion, user permissions and integrity constraints.

**Blackjack Game - TCP Group-Project:** - [Link to Github Page](https://github.com/bmmurthum/BlackJack-p2p)

This group project was assigned towards the end of the semester in a Data Communications course. The game was largely an exercise of handling TCP sockets, and managing various data-types being communicated between various processes. The game was built on a framework that we had developed as a group through the semester. 

A few notes of my focus on this project: I made sure to have my code be compliant to the [GVSU Style-Guideline](http://www.cis.gvsu.edu/java-coding-style-guide/) using [Checkstyle](http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/). I made the design diagram using the website [Draw.io](https://www.draw.io/). A teammate and I, in pair-programming, put particular emphasis to an actively updating elements of the user GUI, where the "Central-Server" would send packets to individual users of which games are available to be joined. I also put time into the visual appeal of the "Lobby GUI."

**Napster Redesign - TCP Group-Project:** - [Download Project PDF](https://github.com/bmmurthum/NapsterRedesign/raw/master/InitialProject/Project2_Report.pdf) - [Link to Github Page](https://github.com/bmmurthum/NapsterRedesign)

This group project was developed throughout the semester as we learned concepts networking concepts. The project is a loosely mirrored example of the Napster system: a peer-to-peer file-sharing system. The basic architecture is that of a main-server that handles connections of clients that send the main-server their information of which files they are making available to other clients. This project was a large exercise in managing group-development cycles and communication within a four-person group. It was also an exercise in Java's Swing library and Java's interaction with XML files.
